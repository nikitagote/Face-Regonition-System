# Face-Regonition-System

In this COVID-19 situation, there is a need to have a robust Face Recognition System for person authentication which will not require physical contact on behalf of the user. Although there are such systems available and there doesnâ€™t require any physical contact with a human, it also has its drawbacks. That there might be a slight chance that sometimes the face may not be recognized due to some problems. Those can be pose variation, some parts of the face cannot be found because of goggles, beards, certain haircuts, hats, etc. To implement the Face Recognition System using Machine Learning concepts such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to overcome the limitations of the existing system and to achieve greater efficiency.
